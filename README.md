# Getting Started with Create React App

## Intro
The project idea from the Scrimba youtube video.

As my first time familiar with react, it is easy to build although I have no experience in coding javascript LMAO. Therefore, my code maybe not that clean and please forgive me Orz.

Feel free to use the code and I have also deployed the web app through the Firebase.

## Have fun :)
